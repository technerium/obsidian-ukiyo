# Ukiyo

This is a fork of original theme developed by Kinmury.

Welcome to <b>Ukiyo</b>, an Obsidian theme which main focus is to ease your eyes while using this amazing app, reducing the unnecessary empty spaces from UI elements so that you can have more room for the important stuff: <i>your notes</i>.

# Style Settings

- **[Modes](./docs/modes.md)** - Change the way the UI is displayed. Note that you can't use both modes, you have to disable one in order to use the other.
	- _Smooth mode_ - Creates space between the different elements.
 	- _Minimal mode_ - Compacts the interface and hides most elements. 
- **[Color Scheme](./docs/color-scheme.md)** - Change the color palette used.
	- _Selector_ - Choose between the already existing color schemes.
 	- _Custom_ - If you choose the custom option from the selector, a list of options will appear that lets you create your own color scheme for the theme.
- **[Pop Out Callout](./docs/custom-callouts.md)** - Whenever you use a pop-out callout and you switch between source view to reading view, all the pop-out callout will play a slide-out animation. You can turn that off by changing the value to 0.
- **[Floating Sides](./docs/floating-sides.md)** - The side panels will appear above all other elements of the interface.
